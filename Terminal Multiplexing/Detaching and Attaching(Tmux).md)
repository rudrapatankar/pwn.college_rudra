# Terminal Multiplexing

## Detaching And Attaching

Let's try the same thing with tmux!

tmux (terminal multiplexer) is screen's younger, more modern cousin. It does all the same things but with some different key bindings. The biggest difference? Instead of Ctrl-A, tmux uses Ctrl-B as its command prefix.

So to detach from tmux, you press Ctrl-B followed by d.

hacker@dojo:~$ tmux
[doing some work...]
[Press Ctrl-B, then d]
[detached (from session 0)]
hacker@dojo:~$ 
The commands also differ:

tmux ls - List sessions
tmux attach or tmux a - Reattach to session
For this challenge:

Launch tmux
Detach from it.
Run /challenge/run (this will send the flag to your detached session!)
Reattach to see your prize

### Solve
**Flag:**  pwn.college{Q7pv8IUGqhN0uQy2dmTPXFVLp1r.0VO4IDOxwiNxIzNzEzW}

run tmux then detach doing ctrl-B+d then do /challenge/run then tmux a to reattach.

```bash
command 1
command 2
pwn.college{helloworld}
```

### New Learnings
tmux a to reattach session of tmux and to detach use ctrl-B+d
