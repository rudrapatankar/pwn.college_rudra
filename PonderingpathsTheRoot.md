# Pondering Paths

## The Root

Challenge description : 

the filesystem starts at /. Under that, there are a whole mess of other directories, configuration files, programs, and, most importantly, flags. In this level, we've added a program right in /, called pwn, that will give you the flag. All you need to do for this level is to invoke this program!

You can invoke a program by providing its path on the command line. In this case, you'll be giving the exact path, starting from /, so the path would be /pwn. This style of path, one that starts with the root directory, is referred to as an "absolute path".

### Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{Yim_pIeo8P3kDCRottSH6EdkQAA.QX4cTO0wiNxIzNzEzW}

type in your solve and your thought process behind solving the challenge. Include as much as info as possible. Use triple ticks for any bash commands and output you type on the terminal.

```bash
/pwn
pwn.college{Yim_pIeo8P3kDCRottSH6EdkQAA.QX4cTO0wiNxIzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
Filesystem starts with '/'. Using /pwn we can invoke program. This saves time of execution and shortens program length as only one keyword is required to invoke a big program
