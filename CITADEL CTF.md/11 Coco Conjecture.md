The description and transformations mentioned in [Coco_Conjecture.pdf](Coco_Conjecture.pdf) are self-explanatory. 

This mathematical problem is called [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture).

With the help of the pdf we can make a function that will calculate the collatz steps for each number returned by the server, and using `helper.md` which is provided along with the pdf, we can modify the script to communicate with the instance via `socket` or `pwntools`.
