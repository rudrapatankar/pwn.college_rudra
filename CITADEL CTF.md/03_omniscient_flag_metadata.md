## Omniscient Flag's Metadata

**Category**: Forensics

**Difficulty**: Easy

## Description
As you step into the second chamber, a figure manifests before you. Before you stands a forgotten deity, a dead god spoken of only in whispers. Known by countless names: *“Apostle of Epilogue and Eternity,”* *“Lone Messiah”* and many more lost to time.

They leave nothing but a single image, a relic carrying his final secret. Hidden within its layers lies the key to ascend to the next chamber.


## Writeup

As the challenge talks about Metadata we first run `exiftool` on the image.
```

```

we get a big hint - `kdj had a habit of hiding images within images`. this clearly means a image is hidden within this image. We can extract the embedded image using `foremost` or `binwalk`.

Here we run `foremost` on challenge.jpg to extract the hidden image within the file. Alternatively we can also use `binwalk` on the terminal or its [online alternative](https://www.unroll.ing/)

This gives us the embedded PNG which gives us the flag.
