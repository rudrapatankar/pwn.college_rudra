# Digesting Documentation

## Reading Manuals
This level introduces the man command. man is short for manual, and will display (if available) the manual of the command you pass as an argument. For example, let's say we wanted to learn about the yes command (yes, this is a real command):

hacker@dojo:~$ man yes
This will display the manual page for yes, which will look something like this:

YES(1)                           User Commands                          YES(1)

GNU coreutils 8.32               February 2022                          YES(1)
The important sections are:

NAME(1)                           CATEGORY                          NAME(1)

NAME
	This gives the name (and short description) of the command or
	concept discussed by the page.

SYNOPSIS
	This gives a short usage synopsis. These synopses have a standard
	format. Typically, each line is a different valid invocation of the
	command, and the lines can be read as:

	COMMAND [OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT] SINGLE_MANDATORY_ARGUMENT
	COMMAND [OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT] MULTIPLE_ARGUMENTS...

DESCRIPTION
	Details of the command or concept, with detailed descriptions
	of the various options.

SEE ALSO
	Other man pages or online resources that might be useful.

COLLECTION                        DATE                          NAME(1)
You can scroll around the manpage with your arrow keys and PgUp/PgDn. When you're done reading the manpage, you can hit q to quit.

Manpages are stored in a centralized database. If you're curious, this database lives in the /usr/share/man directory, but you never need to interact with it directly: you just query it using the man command. The arguments to the man command aren't file paths, but just the names of the entries themselves (e.g., you run man yes to look up the yes manpage, rather than man /usr/bin/yes, which would be the actual path to the yes program but would result in man displaying garbage).

The challenge in this level has a secret option that, when you use it, will cause the challenge to print the flag. You must learn this option through the man page for challenge!

### Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{sfXytiw7Ao0CRRRcK4zw562p5_b.QX0EDO0wiNxIzNzEzW}

doing man challenge displays manual of challenge. The command --sfytiw NUM gives the flag on passing NUM as 704 

```bash
man challenge
/challenge/challenge --sfytiw 704
pwn.college{sfXytiw7Ao0CRRRcK4zw562p5_b.QX0EDO0wiNxIzNzEzW}
```
