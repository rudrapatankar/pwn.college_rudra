# Comprehending commands

## catting absolute paths

In the last level, you did cat flag to read the flag out of your home directory!.In this directory, I will not copy it to your home directory, but I will make it readable. You can read it with cat at its absolute path: /flag.


### Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{8a-YvtwqveYRMOnCa5szdNMwFuc.QX5ETO0wiNxIzNzEzW}

we can also read files by putting absolute path as arguments of cat

```bash
cat /flag
pwn.college{8a-YvtwqveYRMOnCa5szdNMwFuc.QX5ETO0wiNxIzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
cat function not only reads files from names but also from the location mentioned by us
