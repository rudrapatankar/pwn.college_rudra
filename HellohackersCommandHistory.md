# Hello Hackers

## Command History

Description : type history in the terminal as command. It gives a whole list of commands used in earlier code because typing everything from scratch is annoying. Flag is injected in the history

### Solve
**Flag:** pwn.college{89BLChewTgFEKZOEavOxLAdkBO0.0lNzEzNxwiNxIzNzEzW}

type in your solve and your thought process behind solving the challenge. Include as much as info as possible. Use triple ticks for any bash commands and output you type on the terminal.

```bash
history
pwn.college{89BLChewTgFEKZOEavOxLAdkBO0.0lNzEzNxwiNxIzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
We can improve the code reusuability by using the history command as it gives the list of all the saved commands of earlier code. We need not write all the code from scratch as we can copy it from the history.
