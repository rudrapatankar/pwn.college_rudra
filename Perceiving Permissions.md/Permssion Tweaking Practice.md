# Perceiving Permissions

## Permssion Tweaking Practice

You think you can chmod? Let's practice!

This challenge will ask you to change the permissions of the /challenge/pwn file in specific ways a few times in a row. If you get the permissions wrong, the game will reset and you can try again. If you get the permissions right eight times in a row, the challenge will let you chmod /flag to make it readable for yourself :-) Launch /challenge/run to get started!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{helloworld}`

Round 1 : chmod g-r /challenge/pwn
Round 2 : chmod o-r /challenge/pwn
Round 3 : chmod u-wx /challenge/pwn
Round 4 : chmod u+x /challenge/pwn
Round 5: chmod o+rwx /challenge/pwn
Round 6 : chmod u+wx /challenge/pwn
Round 7 : chmod g+rw /challenge/pwn
Round 8 :chmod u=w,g=w,o=rwx /challenge/pwn
Then change permissions of /flag using chmod a+r then cat /flag
```bash
Round 2 of 8!

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod a+r /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{ArVpoXuL-dbDTmx88QAprBuI3OV.QXwEjN0wiNxIzNzEzW}
